# Micheal Felobes  
*Junior Web Developer based in Toronto, ON*  

Hi! I'm Micheal — a junior full-stack web developer who enjoys learning by building. I’m especially interested in how modern tools like **React**, **TypeScript**, **WordPress (headless)**, and **Tailwind CSS** can help create simple, responsive, and engaging websites.

I got into web development through school, freelancing, and just messing around with side projects. I’m always exploring something new — whether that’s animations with **GSAP** or connecting front ends to custom APIs. I don’t have all the answers yet, but I’m excited to keep learning and building things that work. 🚀

## Projects

Here are a few projects I’ve worked on that helped me grow as a developer:

- [**CodeITos**](http://codeitos.mfelobes.ca) – A beginner-friendly dev blog built with React and a headless WordPress CMS. It's where I share things I'm learning (and where others can too). ✍️  
- [**Capstone Foundation**](http://capstonefund.vercel.app) – A startup incubator site built for a school project using React, TypeScript, and a CMS. It taught me a lot about building responsive front ends. 🌱

## Currently Exploring
 
- CMS flexibility with WordPress + Next.js 🧩  
- Building better UI/UX with animations and transitions ✨
- Learning ASP.NET Core and C# ⚙️

## Let’s Connect

I’m always happy to connect with other developers, especially if you're learning too. 🤝
